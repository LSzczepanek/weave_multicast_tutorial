========================

Please see **URL HERE** for the blog that this tutorial supports.

If you have a Digital Ocean account and you've already set up tugboat on your machine then just:

    git clone https://github.com/cazcade/weave_multicast_tutorial.git
    cd weave_multicast_tutorial
    ./create_digital_ocean_example.sh

When you're finished:

    ./cleanup.sh

Obviously creating droplets will incur charges.
