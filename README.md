Weave Multicast Tutorial
========================

Please see **URL HERE** for the blog that this tutorial supports.

The [blog post's source](https://github.com/cazcade/weave_multicast_tutorial/blob/master/blog_post.md) will guide you through using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Weave](https://github.com/zettio/weave) to create a multicast network on a public cloud.

If you have a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7b4639fc8194) account and you've already set up [Tugboat](https://github.com/pearkes/tugboat) on your machine then just:

    git clone https://github.com/cazcade/weave_multicast_tutorial.git
    cd weave_multicast_tutorial
    ./create_digital_ocean_example.sh

When you're finished:

    ./cleanup.sh

Obviously creating droplets will incur charges.
